        <p>Wednesday, 23.8</p>
        <p>First day at work. I got introduced further to the staff and shown deeper into the workspace of all the 5 work levels of the office. I got my own keycard to get around on my own. Registered onto my work environment, laptop and work phone as well as added to have access to the main framework of the company. Tomorrow I get the access to that framework, today has mostly been a setup introduction day to get started. The people I've met so far have all been very nice</p>
        <p>Thursday, 24.8</p>
        <p>Second day at work. I got access to the Raksystems ICT Documentation. Read lots of the guides inside the network, basically this is their "Technical Documentation" where they aim to document a, in their words "an agile and flexible IT as a service to all the companies and users within the Raksystems Group". In short, a useful database for tech support across the whole Raksystems Group. I got to be involved in Teams meetings, I didn't quite put myself out there, I focused on the material, it was a great learning experience. I also got to work with IT Servicedesk help tickets. </p>
        <p>Friday, 25.8</p>
        <p>Third day at work. I got the opportunity to build a new monitor for my temporary setup. As well as continued to work with the help tickets, wasn't much for me to do over there today. I helped setup a work laptop for an employee, install it's required programs and services ready for the person. Got to borrow a Mac Book to bring home, since I will be working from home studying it. And I'm also going to be part of an IT Meeting with the IT Manager as well as others in this space, voluntarily, on Monday 28th. I also got access to a wip project, which I will be helping to work on starting next week(?)</p>
        <p>Wednesday, 30.8</p>
        <p>Fourth day at work. Starting to work my way through the Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Training course on Microsoft's learning website, in specifics to learn about the services, identity types, and the access management capabilities of Azure Active Directory. The basics of how it works and what it's used for. Also continued to work on the IT Servicedesk tickets. Helped setup Macbooks, Dropbox and Microsoft Defender installation as well as messing with Administrative permissions. I got to work on you could say clearing laptops and phones, putting their respected serials in our system to retire them from their old owners, so they can be given forward to new employees or even thrown out I'm guessing. They're marked as EOL, End Of Life. I was part of a meeting to discuss evuluation of another Microsoft service to help with security.</p>
        <p>Thursday, 31.8</p>
        <p>Fifth day at work. Main things. I got to be part of another meeting, got some stuff to do. I helped someone install new versions of software for them, through TeamViewer. As well as we have a monitor problem with a few models, which we are working on switching out because of safety issues. So I spent a lot of my day working to switch them out, and labeling them as being Out Of Order in our storage. As well as being assigned for the rest of the day, to seek and replace a faulty monitor model from a certain company to take out of use from our employees.</p>
        <p>Friday, 1.9</p>
        <p>Sixth day at work. Following up yesterday on the faulty monitors, I was asked to go back to help fix the setup I reworked to fit with other monitors. I couldn't manage to get all 3 monitors working for him, reason why I don't know. But I did all the troubleshooting methods I'm aware of. Switched cables around and put them differently as well as messed with the monitor settings, and tried to tweak them on his computer as well. But a sacrifice had to be made, could manage to only get 2 monitors working simultaneously for now. But I created a ticket about the problem, and hopefully someone else from my team can handle it. Went back upstairs to meet the new CEO of the company, he was really nice. And to replace another faulty monitor.</p>
